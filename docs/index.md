- Overrides the built-in tab commands and 'close' and 'close_all' commands to work with sticky tabs (ST3 only)

- Add open last tab, reveal in sidebar or finder, copy file path, save options, and revert
- Adds tab sorting options (based loosely on @bizoo's [SortTabs](https://github.com/bizoo/SortTabs) plugin)
- Access clone, delete, rename, save, reveal, copy file path, revert, etc.

# ST2 Support?
Sorry, there are no plans for ST2 support.
